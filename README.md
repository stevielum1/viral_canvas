### Background and Overview
`Viral Canvas` is a simulation of moving particles colliding in a confined space. A certain number of particles are "infected". Each time a collision occurs with an "infected" particle, that particle also becomes infected, thus spreading the infection at an accelerated rate.

### Architectures and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and game logic,
- `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation and rendering,
- `Paper.js` for handling particle creation and rendering
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts
